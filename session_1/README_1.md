# Session 1, Project-ETHDenver-bootcamp
17 October 2022
# Zoom session

* 154 attendants
* Overall: sessions will be 45' theory, 45' practice. Will use Remix, VSCode in Gitpod, Hardhat and Foundry

  *If you haven’t heard about Foundry, it’s a development framework just like Hardhat. It was developed by Dapp Tools to compete with similar frameworks like Hardhat and Brownie. The key difference is the programming language used to write tests and scripts. While Hardhat uses JavaScript to write tests and deployment scripts for your smart contracts, Foundry uses the native Solidity programming language to do all of that. That’s why it has gained a lot of popularity recently. More here: https://www.helpmegeek.com/how-to-integrate-foundry-hardhat-project/*
