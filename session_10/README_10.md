* Session 10 useful links during lecture:
  * Initial post of Vitalik about Automated Market Maker: https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/06/22/marketmakers.html,
  * Curve Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) running on Ethereum. It's specifically designed for swapping between stablecoins. It is focused on stablecoins and provides low fees, impermanent loss, and minimal slippage rates. While Uniswap focuses on being a general-purpose DEX for all assets, Curve started out with a very specific focus – pegged assets. Curve intended to build an extremely efficient DEX to trade stablecoins and liquid derivatives.
  * Maker DAI, the first stablecoin.
  * Yearn Finance, a collection of smart contracts working together to simplify yield farming (users locking their crypto assets in DeFi protocols for earning interest). It moves crypto assets from one decentralized lending protocol to another and optimizes the use of Curve Finance, Compound and Aave: https://docs.yearn.finance/.
