* 118 attendants, Sushiswap story
  * Sushiswap is a fork of Uniswap
  * Uniswap was launched in 2018. It's a decentralized exchange using an Automated Market Maker (AMM). People contribute to liquidity pools and are rewarded with UNI tokens. Very popular and launched the DeFi wave.
  * Compound is a tool to allow "yield farming", funded by VC. Yearn is a decentralized asset management platform like Compound but community backed.
  * A lot of other "meme coins" or "food coins" are speculative tools, community backed. The first was YAM, fast rise and fast fall.
  * Sushiswap is a similar food coin, and is a fork of Uniswap with a governance token, that Uniswap V1 didn't have.

# Homework
## Assignment: 
Hacking game not ready yet, so we continue VolcanoCoin.
1.	Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself).
2.	Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where we can store metadata / images for the NFT.
3.	What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token URI?
4.	Review the notes about the EVM in Lesson 5 in preparation for tomorrow's lesson about gas optimisation.
